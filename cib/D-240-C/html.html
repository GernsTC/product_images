<p>In Japanese, “Dozuki” translates to “tenon shoulder”. A tenon shoulder requires a precise crosscut and this saw is filed with fine crosscut teeth at 25 TPI and a thin 0.011” blade making it superbly accurate, fast, and smooth cutting. Specifically designed for tenon shoulders, dovetail shoulders, Kumiko, and other fine crosscutting jobs in soft or hard woods.</p>
<p>The high-grade SK85 Japanese tool steel blade is 240mm (9.5”) long, which we consider a standard length saw. The blade is supported by a premium solid brass back and secured with brass hardware making the saw sturdy but allows for quick and easy blade replacement.</p>
<p>The handle made of Japanese Wingnut (in the walnut family) is stained a rich dark brown color and accented with natural rattan wraps for added beauty, comfort, and grip. The blade has a squared end to help users quickly distinguish it from our rip-cut version that has a rounded end.</p>
<p>Expertly crafted in Japan, Temple Tool Co. blends legendary Japanese craftsmanship with our signature Western aesthetics to create timeless tools that perform as good as they look.</p>
<p>This is a go-to saw for beginners or professionals wanting a dedicated fine crosscut saw. Match this saw with our Rip-Cut version for a truly dynamic pair of saws to handle any fine joinery needs with The "Joinery Master" Dozuki Combo!</p>
