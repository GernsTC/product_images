<p>"Ryoba," meaning "double-edged" in Japanese, refers to its versatile two-sided blade: one edge with rip teeth for cutting along the grain, and the other with crosscut teeth for cutting across the grain.</p>

The compact design enhances user control and precision, making it an excellent choice for those new to Japanese saws as well as seasoned professionals seeking a smaller Ryoba for specialized projects.</p>
<p>The handle made of Japanese Wingnut (in the walnut family) is stained a rich dark brown color and accented with natural rattan wraps for added beauty, comfort, and grip. Premium brass hardware secures the 0.02” blade to handle and allows for easy blade replacement.</p>
