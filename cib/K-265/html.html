<p>Kataba translates to single edge. Kataba saws can come in a wide variety of shapes, tooth grinds (for Rip or Crosscutting), different TPI, and lengths for a wide variety of tasks. This is our “General Purpose Universal-Cut” version which meets the widest range of general woodworking tasks. The blade is 265mm with a fairly aggressive universal cut tooth pattern at 14.4 TPI. The Universal teeth have a series of crosscut and hybrid rip teeth along its cutting edge that allows the saw to crosscut, rip-cut, and diagonally cut equally well.</p>
<p>The size, TPI, and universal teeth make this saw a great general purpose saw for dimensioning stock and cutting medium to large joinery. The Kataba is similar to the Double-Edge Ryoba in that it excels in a wide range of general purpose tasks. However the Kataba is preferred over the Ryoba by some craftsman who make many deep cuts into and through wood. Because the Kataba only has one edge it doesn’t bind in the cut like a Ryoba might that has a trailing edge with teeth that might bind in the saw kerf.</p>
<p>The blade is made of premium SK85 Japanese tool steel and the teeth are impulse hardened for extreme sharpness and durability. The blade is easily replaceable. The handle is made of Japanese Wingnut, stained a dark rich color and wrapped with natural rattan wraps for attractive contrasting aesthetics and increased grip.</p>
<p>Expertly crafted in Japan, Temple Tool Co. blends legendary Japanese craftsmanship with our signature Western aesthetics to create timeless tools that perform as good as they look.</p>
