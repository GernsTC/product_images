<p>"Ryoba," meaning "double-edged" in Japanese, refers to its versatile two-sided blade: one edge with rip teeth for cutting along the grain, and the other with crosscut teeth for cutting across the grain.</p>
<p>The high-grade SK85 Japanese tool steel blade is 240mm (9.5”) long, which we consider a standard length saw. The handle made of Japanese Wingnut (in the walnut family) is stained a rich dark brown color and accented with natural rattan wraps for added beauty, comfort, and grip. Premium brass hardware secures the 0.019” blade to handle and allows for easy blade replacement.</p>
<p>We carefully designed the blade with specific TPI and tooth geometry to create an exceptional general-purpose saw ideal for resizing stock as well as cutting medium to large joinery making it an indispensable tool for any woodworker.</p>
<p>Expertly crafted in Japan, Temple Tool Co. blends legendary Japanese craftsmanship with our signature Western aesthetics to create timeless tools that perform as good as they look.</p>
