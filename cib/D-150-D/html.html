<p>In Japanese “Dozuki” translates to “tenon shoulder” and typically come with crosscut teeth to make tenon shoulder crosscuts. However, we designed this saw with a special blade that has a combination of crosscut teeth AND Rip teeth to make a universal cutting blade that can efficiently make crosscuts, rip-cuts, and diagonal cuts.</p>
<p>We nicknamed this the “Little Demon” Saw because of its small size, fierce cutting ability, and the special rip-tooth called an “Oni-Ba” or “Demon tooth”. It gets that name from the traditional “Oni” or “Demon” masks that the Samurai wore into battle to strike fear into their enemies.</p>
<p>Although this saw may appear intimidating it is surprisingly easy to start and use. It has a long series of crosscut teeth at the heal of the saw to easily and smoothly start the cut, followed by the repeating pattern of crosscut teeth and single “demon” rip tooth. A deep gullet in front of the rip tooth helps quickly pick up and remove waste for fast cutting in all directions.</p>
<p>Designed as an ideal introductory tool for those new to Dozuki saws, this compact and easy-to-control saw empowers users to tackle a variety of small to mid-sized joinery projects with just a single saw.</p>
<p>The high-grade SK85 Japanese tool steel blade is 150mm (6”) long. The blade is supported by a premium solid brass back and secured with brass hardware making blade replacement quick and easy. The handle made of Japanese Wingnut (in the walnut family) is stained a rich dark brown color and accented with natural rattan wraps for added beauty, comfort, and grip.</p>
