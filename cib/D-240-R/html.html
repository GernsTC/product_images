<p>In Japanese, “Dozuki” means “tenon shoulder.” Most Dozuki saws are filed with crosscut teeth for those tenon shoulder cuts, but this saw is specifically designed with true rip-cut teeth at a fine 18 TPI. The proper name for this type of rip-tooth back saw is “Hozohiki.” However, “Dozuki” has somewhat changed meanings over time and is now mainly used to describe any Japanese saw with a “back”.</p>
<p>This saw carries the prestigious honor of being our “Dovetail Saw.” It was carefully designed to quickly and accurately make those critical rip cuts and leave an ultra-smooth surface needed for dovetails, tenon cheeks, and other fine rip cuts. This saw truly is a professional grade Dovetail Saw, and we truly believe it’s the best on the market!</p>
<p>The high-grade SK85 Japanese tool steel blade is 240mm (9.5”) long, which is considered a standard length saw. The fine 0.011” blade is supported by a premium solid brass back and secured with brass hardware which makes blade replacement easy. The handle made of Japanese Wingnut (in the walnut family) is stained a rich dark brown color and accented with natural rattan wraps for added beauty, comfort, and grip. The blade has a rounded end to help users quickly distinguish it from our crosscut version that has a squared end.</p>
