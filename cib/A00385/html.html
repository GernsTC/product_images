<p>Introducing the ADA Cube 3D – Your Compact Laser Level for Precision Marking!</p>
<p><strong>Versatile Marking</strong>: The ADA Cube 3D is your go-to tool for a wide range of marking tasks. Hang that shelf or picture with ease, put up wallpapers flawlessly, set conduit for electrical wiring, or create perfect guides for your suspended ceiling - all made simple with this compact line laser.</p>
<p><strong>Effortless Vertical Marking</strong>: Thanks to its two intersecting vertical lines set at a perfect 90° angle, planning room divisions, partitions, or laying floor tiles becomes a breeze. You can even visualize future walls effortlessly by adjusting the position of the level.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Battery Management</strong>: Save battery power by switching off unused laser lines. You can easily toggle between laser beams with a handy button located on the instrument's side edge. Choose from one horizontal and two vertical lines, a single vertical line, or a laser cross. And if your battery's running low, the laser lines will start blinking to let you know.</p>
<p><strong>Robust and User-Friendly Design</strong>: The Cube's housing is not just compact, but also durable. Shaped like a cube with an edge area of just 6.5 cm, it's designed to withstand the rigors of your work. Rubber parts provide added protection against accidental damage, and the ribbed surface ensures a secure grip.</p>
<p><strong>Effortless Operation</strong>: Turning on and unlocking the Cube is a snap with the push of a button. Its pendulum system ensures quick alignment to the vertical position, with a maximum deviation of only 3°. If there's any deviation, an acoustic alarm will alert you. Plus, it's easy to mount on a tripod or versatile fixing with its 1/4" thread at the bottom.</p>
